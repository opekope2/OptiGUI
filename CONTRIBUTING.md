# How to contribute?

Hello there! I'm glad you'd like to make OptiGUI a better mod.

## I fixed something in OptiGUI

Cool!

1. Clone the repository (including the `dev` branch, not `main` branch only)
2. Create a new branch from `dev`
3. Commit your changes. Make sure to format the code and optimize imports. Use *Kotlin style guide* in IDEA
4. Open a pull request to the `dev` branch. OptiGUI development happens on the `dev` branch. The `main` branch is only
   for releases
