# OptiGUI

This branch is no longer used since version 2.3.0-beta.3, when the repository structure was changed to the following:

* `dev`: The new main branch. Development happens here, just like before.
  Create branches from here, and open pull requests here
* `release/*`: New release branches for each supported (or legacy) Minecraft version.
  These replace `main` as a single release branch
